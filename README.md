## Introduction
Hi! Isaac here. 

This is a game I made for my assignment during my Foundation Year.
In this 2-player platformer shooting game your goal is to shoot down your opponent penguin
with a variety of guns. (Not all of them are "guns" though)
The game is endless - whoever reaches a set score wins.

Bring in your friends and have fun! :D

Game is built using Unity, updated to version 2018.3.14f1.
